we need a website for bots and DB (php, MySQL)
# for website https://www.000webhost.com/



Hi, after a fast meet we made some changes to the original idea.
1. there will be no account or currency or EXP or <add similar things here>
2. we will have a web server (without database), this is needed to provide bots and
	some logic
3. bots are stupid (just play random)
4. game list (all will be playable through internet):
	- tic tac toe
	- dices
	- flip a coin (also working offline)
	- rock paper scissors
	- blow the ball
5. we'll have some kind of annoying background song	
6. we'll have settings with inside:
	- remove the song (mute/unmute)
	- block vibrations (on/off)
	- report a problem or suggest improvements (saved to a file inside the server)
	- switch to dark mode
7. we are going to need a lot of layouts:
	- small screen (4.5'')
	- big screen (10'')
	- portray
	- landscape
   each of them have to be for the home screen,
   for every one of the games and one for settings
