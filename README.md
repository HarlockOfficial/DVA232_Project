## SECTIONS
### 1. ABSTRACT
### 1. INTRODUCTION 
- a brief summary
### 1. IDEA - MARKO
- brainstorming process {
	how did we come up with the idea?
	what was the first idea?
	-- the goals of the project --
	why was the first idea discarded?
	what choices were made?
	what was the focus?
}
- choice of games {
	what games were chosen?
	why we chose those games? (use of sensors, learning about sensors)
}
- high quality criteria {
	Why we chose this idea?
	Why we chose these games?
}
- first sketch of the system {
	- insert  picture figure 1. first draft how we imagine the system
}
- comparison to other games on the appstore
### 1. WORKFLOW - MARKO
- ways of working
- group communication (what tools did we use to communicate: whatsapp, git-trello, git: commit comments)
- timeplan (what was the task schedulling, mention project due dates from canvas guidelines)
- meeting scheduling and general meeting agendas
	- meetings with supervisors (how often, sprints, what we discussed, what it looked like, what we did in general)
	- meetings within group (how often, sprints, what we discussed, what it looked like, what we did in general)
- frameworks (why, benefits)
- IDE (why, benefits)
- APIs (why, benefits)
- Kotlin, Python, SQL, PHP (why, benefits) - FRANCESCO
### 1. DESIGN
- requirements (rephrase content from document that we sent to afshin)
- how the app will be used
	- use cases
	- use case diagram
	- user experience
- user interface - ERNEST
	- activity diagram
	-- what decisions did we make? --
	-- why we made those decisions? --
	- user experience
- system
	- overview with components diagram - MICHAL
	- bots (functionality and user experience) - FRANCESCO
	- database and ER diagram - FRANCESCO
	-- what decisions did we make? --
	-- why we made those decisions? --
	- user experience
### 1. THE APP - ALFONS
- (functionality)
- screenshots of the app/activities
- games (tic-tac-toe, rock-paper-scissors, blowing game, dices, flip a coin)
### 1. DISCUSSION - ZYLAN
-- user tests, their feedback and how that affected your design --
- future upgrades
	- put less stress on server (lower ping)
	- let real users test the app and fix the app according to user feedback
	- less data bandwidth
	- more games
	- more functionaliteis (removing vibrations, animations, dark mode, landscape, sending user feedback (see project proposal))
### 1. GLOSSARY (?) (preferably, if we have lots of pictures it wouod be nice to be able to ship to sections)
### 1. REFERENCES


### website: https://dva232-project-group-7.000webhostapp.com/

1. there will be no account or currency or EXP or <add similar things here>
2. we will have a web server (with database), this is needed to provide bots and
	some logic
3. bots are stupid (just play random)
4. game list (all will be playable through internet):
	- tic tac toe
	- dices
	- flip a coin (also working offline)
	- rock paper scissors
	- blow the ball
5. we'll have some kind of annoying background song	
6. we'll have settings with inside:
	- remove the song (mute/unmute)
	- block vibrations (on/off)
	- report a problem or suggest improvements (saved to a file inside the server)
	- switch to dark mode
7. we are going to need a lot of layouts:
	- small screen (4.5'')
	- big screen (10'')
	- portray
	- landscape
   each of them have to be for the home screen,
   for every one of the games and one for settings
