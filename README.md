	> how we imagine the system at first?
	> insert  picture figure 1. first draft
- comparison to other games on the appstore
### 4. WORKFLOW - MARKO

- group communication
	> what tools did we use to communicate: </br>
	> whatsapp, git-trello, git: commit comments </br>
- timeplan (what was the task schedulling, mention project due dates from canvas guidelines)
- meeting scheduling and general meeting agendas

- APIs (why, benefits)
- Kotlin, Python, SQL, PHP (why, benefits) - FRANCESCO
### 5. PROJECT DESIGN
- requirements (rephrase content from document that we sent to afshin)
- how the app will be used
	- use cases
	- use case diagram
	- user experience
- user interface - ERNEST
	- activity diagram
	- user experience
	> -- what decisions did we make? -- </br>
	> -- why we made those decisions? -- </br>
- system
	- overview with components diagram - MICHAL
	- bots (functionality and user experience) - FRANCESCO
	- database and ER diagram - FRANCESCO
	- user experience
	>-- what decisions did we make? -- </br>
	>-- why we made those decisions? -- </br>
### 6. THE APP - ALFONS
- functionality
- screenshots of the app/activities
- games (tic-tac-toe, rock-paper-scissors, blowing game, dices, flip a coin)
### 7. DISCUSSION - ZYLAN
- -- user tests, their feedback and how that affected your design --
- future upgrades
	- put less stress on server (lower ping)
	- let real users test the app and fix the app according to user feedback
	- less data bandwidth
	- more games
	- more functionaliteis
		- removing vibrations, animations, dark mode, landscape, sending user feedback (see project proposal)
### 8. GLOSSARY (?) (preferably, if we have lots of pictures it wouod be nice to be able to ship to sections)
### 9. REFERENCES


### website: https://dva232-project-group-7.000webhostapp.com/

1. there will be no account or currency or EXP or <add similar things here>
2. we will have a web server (with database), this is needed to provide bots and
	some logic
3. bots are stupid (just play random)
4. game list (all will be playable through internet):
	- tic tac toe
	- dices
	- flip a coin (also working offline)
	- rock paper scissors
	- blow the ball
5. we'll have some kind of annoying background song	
6. we'll have settings with inside:
	- remove the song (mute/unmute)
	- block vibrations (on/off)
	- report a problem or suggest improvements (saved to a file inside the server)
	- switch to dark mode
7. we are going to need a lot of layouts:
	- small screen (4.5'')
	- big screen (10'')
	- portray
	- landscape
   each of them have to be for the home screen,
   for every one of the games and one for settings
